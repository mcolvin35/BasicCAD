## ***Pull Copter***
### **Description**
Collaborate with a **partner** in Onshape in order to make a working **pull copter toy**
### **Evidence**

### **Reflection**
I learned how to use Onshape to collaborate with others in order to get work done more efficiently. At one point Mohammad and I were in separate rooms so we had to use the comment tool in order to communicate and we made it work!

## ***Swing Arm***
### **Description**
Use the provided resources in order to design a part exactly as intended

### **Reflection**
This assignment was overwhelming at first when I looked at the diagrams, but after I got started I just took it one step at a time and it wasn't so bad. I also learned that the **coincident** constraint also works as a **colinear**. 

## ***Multi-part Studio***
### **Description**
Use the provided **diagrams** and **criteria** to make an object of multiple parts in **one** part studio
### **Evidence**

### **Reflection**
As with the swing arm, looking at the diagrams was super daunting and I just had to get started in order to make sense of everything. The **use** tool was extremely helpful for this assignment as it meant I could put in minimal effort to change the dimensions because everything was based on other parts.
